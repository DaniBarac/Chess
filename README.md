# Chess

This is an implementation of the game of chess. It is built in Java from scratch, making use of Java Swing for the user interface.

The project started as an assignment for University, but the requirements didn't include all the rules of the game (notably they excluded castling, promotion and en passant). I realy like chess, so I decided to try implementing all the rules of the game. Over time, I kept adding new features, including
* a user interface (before it was a console app using unicode characters)
* a (very basic) AI player (disabled by default because it is slow)
